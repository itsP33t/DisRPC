# DisRPC

DisRPC is program that will allow you to have a custom Rich Presence status at your discord profile. There's no need to configure anything. Everything is user friendly with modern ui, not some console application that need you to create config file and if you type something wrong it will crash. In DisRPC you can also save your custom config and last config will always save so when it crashes (never happened to me) you can get everything back with one click.
